snippet_copier.py
=================

A script which downloads snippets from bundles in the `TextMate`_ `svn repo`_
and attempts to create duplicate `YASnippets`_, written by `Jeff Wheeler`_.

Synopsis
========

TextMate bundles include amazingly wonderful tab-triggered snippets, yet these
have been for a long time restricted to only OS X. Emacs, a cross-platform
editor now has a great snippets package, YASnippet, so now it seems necessary
to make the TextMate snippets available for Emacs. This script does just that.

This script may be used as a command-line utility or integrated into other
scripts without problems.

Description
===========

The snippet copier works with two classes:

- ``Snippet`` which represents a generic tab-triggered snippet
- ``TextMateBundle``, an abstract API tied to TextMate's bundles SVN repo

With access to the snippets in the bundle, generic ``Snippet``\ s are created
which then are saved in a local directory.

It's important to remember that not all snippets can be converted directly from
TextMate to YASnippet: they use different syntax for certain things like
embedded code. YASnippet requires lisp, while TextMate uses shell commands
inside snippets. A few other conversions don't work quite right, so it is
likely that some snippets will require manual editing.

Options
=======

Most often, snippets will be copied through the command-line interface. The
script accepts just a few simple arguments:

``--bundle``
        The case-sensitive name of the bundle on the TextMate SVN repository.

``--path``
        The path of the directory to which the snippets should be saved. This
        may be either a relative or absolute path.

``--help``
        Print brief usage information regarding the command-line interface.

Credits
=======

This script was written by `Jeff Wheeler`_, except for the ``unescape``
function which was found on `this site <http://effbot.org/zone/re-sub.htm>`_.

The TextMate bundles were written by many different people, often available in
the *info.plist* file (with the key ``contactName``).

The YASnippet package was written by Chiyuan Zhang (a.k.a. *pluskid*) for
Emacs.
