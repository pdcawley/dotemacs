;;; Commentary:

;; I created this *only* to allow me to open files and do `vc-diff'.
;; If anything else even works, it's not my fault. :) This needs a lot
;; of love before it is a good VC backend, but it will allow you to do
;; some minimal tasks.

;; I primarily use FSF Emacs 22. It may not work with older Emacsen.
;; Or it might, thanks to your bug reports.

;; vc-svn commentary:
;; This is preliminary support for Subversion (http://subversion.tigris.org/).
;; It started as `sed s/cvs/svk/ vc.cvs.el' (from version 1.56)
;; and hasn't been completely fixed since.

;; Sync'd with Subversion's vc-svn.el as of revision 5801.

;;; Bugs:

;; - VC-dired is (really) slow.
;; - (svk) Most other commands are, too.

;;; Changelog:
;; * 20050707: Yikes! My original was inadvertently posted with two instances of misplaced parens/stale code and didn't work at all!
;;
;; * 20050711: Improve handling of files not in the repository.
;;
;; * Old bugs on Emacs 21.4 (are these fixed yet?):
;; 00 (defalias) only takes 2 arguments
;; 00 While switching to vc-dired-mode from dired mode: "No subdir-alist in lib".  vc-directory barfs with "Symbol's function definition is void: vc-stay-local-p".
;; 00 Loading any file yields "Symbol's definition is void: assoc-string".
;; 00 hate hate hate.
;;
;; * 20050816:
;; 00 Fixed more problems with added and unknown files.
;; 00 Fixed the `time-less-p' and `assoc-string' problems on Emacs <22.
;; 00 Fixed some unsual cases in vc-svk-do-status.
;; 00 Fixed vc-register (also fixes the defalias problem on Emacs <22).
;; 00 *May* fix the vc-dired problem. I can't test this, and don't use it.
;;
;; * 20050817:
;; 00 Handle directories correctly in `vc-svk-registered'.
;; 00 A few more compatibility fixes.
;;
;; * 20051006:
;; 00 Less crashing for subdirectories that aren't registered.
;; 00 Misc. cleanups.
;;
;; * 20051017:
;; 00 Tweak last fix.
;;
;; * 20051025:
;; 00 Require SVK 1.03, use it to get better status.
;; 00 Support vc-annotate (C-x v g) (more to be done).
;;
;; * 20051026: (The first new features in vc-svk that aren't in vc-svn!)
;; 00 Accurate coloring in vc-annotate. If you don't like the lag while the cache builds, set `vc-svk-annotate-absolutely' to nil.
;; 00 vc-annotate works in Emacs 21.
;;
;; * 20051102:
;; 00 One line fix for symlink to one WD inside another.
;;
;; * 20060219:
;; 00 Fix some rare crashes for un-added subtrees.
;; 00 New feature: `vc-annotate-revision-previous-to-line'
